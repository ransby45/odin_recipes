    <p>Ingredients</p>
    <ul>
      <li>1 (8 ounce) package linguine pasta</li>
      <li>1 cup frozen peas</li>
      <li>5 slices bacon</li>
      <li>1 clove garlic, minced</li>
      <li>1 cup milk</li>
      <li>½ (8 ounce) package cream cheese</li>
      <li>¼ cup grated Parmesan cheese</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Steps</p>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook linguine at a
        boil until tender yet firm to the bite, about 11 minutes, adding peas in
        the last minute of cooking. Drain and keep warm in a bowl.
      </li>
      <li>
        Place bacon in a large skillet and cook over medium-high heat, turning
        occasionally, until evenly browned, about 10 minutes. Transfer bacon to
        paper towels, reserving 1 tablespoon of drippings in the skillet.
      </li>
      <li>
        Add garlic to the skillet; saute for 1 minute. Reduce heat to low and
        stir in milk and cream cheese until blended.
      </li>
      <li>
        Crumble bacon and add to the linguine along with sauce and Parmesan
        cheese; stir to coat.
      </li>
    </ol>
    <p>Cook's note:</p>
